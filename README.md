Gilded Rose Kate- Tech Test week 10

What the hell is this thing supposed to do?

It has Items- a clear Class of its own
  All Items have a sellin value counted in number of days until it must be sold
  All items have a quality
  Once sellin value reached 0 rate of decline doubles
  Quality cannot be less than 0

Aged Brie - alternative class?
  Quality improves with Age
  Quality cannot be higher than 50

Sulfuras - alternative class?
  Never declines in quality

Backstage Passes - Alternative class?
  Similar to aged Brie quality increases as you approach sellin
  Quality improves 2 fold with less than 10 days to go
  Quality improves 3 fold with less than 5 days to go

Conjoured
  Quality declined at twice the normal rate

Normal rate....
What is normal?
Normal needs to be in here
somewhere

Where do all of these items start to countdown/up from?

Write the test suit first, then refactor
